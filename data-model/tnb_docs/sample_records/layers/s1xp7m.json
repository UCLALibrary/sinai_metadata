The letters are 3 mm high and 2-4 mm wide, the space between the lines is 7-8 mm. The margins are large: the internal margin measures 30 mm, the external margin 50 mm, the upper margin 40 mm (the lower margin is not preserved). The written surface is 175 x 155 mm. At the end of the lines the letters are smaller, in order to respect the line division and the justification of the margins, which is a feature typical of luxury codices"
