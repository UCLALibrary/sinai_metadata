Hermon (Jebel Sanir) and from the region of Halbun (حلبون), at about 9:00am (the third hour), Wednesday, on the 28th of Ilul (September); the year 6,104 since our father Adam. His book for his humble self at the holy monastery of Mt. Sinai and he entreats and beseeches to all who would pray it or read it or encounter it and find in it error or defect or loss (sic), let him forgive and pray on account of the sinner and poor writing, that all creation is lacking; my brothers and my fathers pray for the writing of the sinner for to our Lord Jesus Christ be the glory and the worship forever, Amen."
